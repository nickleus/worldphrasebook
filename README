Currently i host the world phrasebook using Google Docs:
http://worldphrasebook.net/phrasebook (redirects to http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pk_yT3zL-5Gp45a3UyKbMOA )

I would like to host the phrasebook on worldphrasebook.net instead.

I would like to create the pages using php and ajax.

See my sketches (attached php files) for ideas of how i want the interface to look.

I appreciate any help i can get =)
Thanks,
Nick Humphrey
